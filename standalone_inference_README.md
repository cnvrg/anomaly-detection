Use this inference blueprint to immediately detect data anomalies or outliers in a dataset. To use this pretrained anomaly-detector model, create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be quickly integrated with your data and application.

This inference blueprint’s model was trained using anomalous customers based on their attributes and subscriptions to services. To use custom data according to your specific business, run this counterpart’s [training blueprint](https://metacloud.cloud.cnvrg.io/marketplace/blueprints/anomaly-detection-train), which trains the model and establishes an endpoint based on the newly trained model.

Complete the following steps to deploy an anomaly-detector API endpoint:

1. Click the **Use Blueprint** button.
2. In the dialog, select the relevant compute to deploy the API endpoint and click the **Start** button.
3. The cnvrg software redirects to your endpoint. Complete one or both of the following options:
   - Use the Try it Live section with any input data point to check your model.
   - Use the bottom integration panel to integrate your API with your code by copying in the code snippet.

An API endpoint that detects whether an input data point is an anomaly has now been deployed. Click [here]() for detailed instructions to run this blueprint. To learn how this blueprint was created, click [here](https://github.com/cnvrg/anomaly-detection).
